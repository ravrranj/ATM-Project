# ATM-Project
using the concept of OOPS and basic java wrote a code to show the working of ATM , wil implement more feature as I learn 


Features:
âœ… User Authentication (PIN-based login)
âœ… Account Balance Check
âœ… Cash Withdrawal (Limit-based)
âœ… Cash Deposit
âœ… Mini Statement (Last 5 transactions)

OOP Concepts Used:
âœ” Encapsulation â†’ Private fields for balance, PIN, transactions
âœ” Inheritance â†’ UserAccount as base class, ATMService as derived class
âœ” Polymorphism â†’ Different transaction types (deposit, withdraw)
âœ” Abstraction â†’ Abstract class for TransactionService


Design the ATM System
We will break it into three main parts:

User Account â†’ Holds balance, PIN, and transaction history.
ATM Services â†’ Handles authentication, withdrawals, deposits, and balance check.
Transaction Log â†’ Stores the last 5 transactions (mini-statement)


 Java Classes & OOP Implementation
ðŸ”¹ 1. UserAccount (Encapsulation)
Fields: accountNumber, pin, balance, ArrayList<String> transactions

Methods: validatePin(), updateBalance(), getLastTransactions()

ðŸ”¹ 2. ATMService (Inheritance & Polymorphism)
Methods: authenticateUser(), withdrawCash(), depositCash(), checkBalance(), printMiniStatement()

ðŸ”¹ 3. TransactionService (Abstraction)
Abstract class for deposit & withdrawal transactions


Steps involved : 

Step 1: Creating the UserAccount Class (Encapsulation)
First, we need a class to store user details (like PIN, balance, and transaction history). This will also have methods to validate the PIN, update balance, and store transactions.

ðŸ”¹ What We'll Do in UserAccount
âœ… Encapsulate user data (account number, PIN, balance)
âœ… Store last 5 transactions using an ArrayList<String>
âœ… Methods:

validatePin(int enteredPin) â†’ boolean

updateBalance(double amount) â†’ void

addTransaction(String transaction) â†’ void

getLastTransactions() â†’ void



Step 2: Creating ATMService Class
This class will handle:
âœ… User Authentication (PIN verification)
âœ… Withdraw Money (Ensure sufficient balance)
âœ… Deposit Money (Increase balance)
âœ… Check Balance (Show available balance)
âœ… Mini Statement (Show last 5 transactions)



Step 3: 
Where we code the ATM system and run to test the program.
